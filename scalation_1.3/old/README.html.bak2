<p>
<b> Welcome to ScalaTion, the Scala-based system for Simulation, Optimization and Analytics. </b>

<p>
This system, coded in Scala, supports multi-paradigm simulation modeling including
'tableau', 'event', 'process', 'dynamics', dynamics_pde, 'activity' and 'state' oriented models.
<a href = "http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> is a modern object-oriented, functional programming language
<!-- (see <a href = "feature_matrix.html"> feature matrix </a>) -->
that is well-suited for developing simulation engines.
ScalaTion also supports optimization and analytics as they nowadays go hand-in-hand with simulation modeling.
Many of the algorithms come in both sequential and parallel versions.

<p>
The <b>ScalaTion 1.1</b> version is a migration from version 1.0 (which works with Scala 2.9.x) to Scala 2.10.x.
Note, the 'minima' package, which is undergoing efficiency improvements, currently has some deprecation warnings.
Future directions include completing the 'scala3d' and 'physics' packages.

<p>
Please read the <a href = LICENSE.html> LICENSE </a> file (an MIT style license).

<h3> Installation Instructions </h3>

Requires:
<a href = "http://www.scala-lang.org/downloads">Scala 2.10.x</a> and
<a href = "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads">Java 7</a>

<h4>1. Download one of the following two files:</h4>

<a href = "../scalation_1.1.tar.gz"> scalation.tar_1.1.gz </a> <br> OR <br>
<a href = "../scalation_1.1.zip"> scalation_1.1.zip </a>

<p>
<h4>2. Untar or unzip the file:</h4>

$ tar xvfz scalation_1.1.tar.gz <br> OR <br>
$ unzip scalation_1.1.zip

<p>
<h4>3. Export the SCALATION_CLASSES environment variable to point at class files: (use the second version for sbt)</h4>

export SCALATION_CLASSES=$HOME/scalation_1.1/classes <br>
#export SCALATION_CLASSES=$HOME/scalation_1.1/target/scala-2.10/classes


<h4>4. ScalaTion is pre-built, but to re-build the ScalaTion system type the first command
or its shorthand (the second):</h4>

$ scala Build <br> OR <br>
$ <a href = "scab">scab</a>

<p>

Source packages are in the <b>src/main/scala</b> directory,
class files are in the <b>target</b> directory, and
documentation files are in the <b>doc</b> directory.
Note: 'scala Build' will place class files in <b>classes</b> directory.

<h4>5. Run apps (e.g., for process oriented simulation in Bank.scala):</h4>

$ scala -cp $SCALATION_CLASSES apps.process.Bank <br> OR <br>
$ <a href = "scar">scar</a> apps.process.Bank

<h4>6. Run src test code (e.g., for Regression in scalation.analytics):</h4>

$ scala -cp $SCALATION_CLASSES scalation.analytics.RegressionTest <br> OR <br>
$ scar scalation.analytics.RegressionTest

<h4>7. To use <a href = "http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13.0/docs/home.html"> sbt </a> to build ScalaTion 1.1:</h4>

$ sbt compile

<h4>8. To develop using an IDE:</h4>

download <a href = "http://typesafe.com/stack/downloads/scala-ide">Scala IDE for Eclipse</a>
